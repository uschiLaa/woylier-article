@article{grandtour1995,
 ISSN = {10618600},
 URL = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/1390844},
 abstract = {The grand tour and projection pursuit are two methods for exploring multivariate data. We show how to combine them into a dynamic graphical tool for exploratory data analysis, called a projection pursuit guided tour. This tool assists in clustering data when clusters are oddly shaped and in finding general low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional, and in particular, sparse data. An example shows that the method, which is projection-based, can be quite powerful in situations that may cause grief for methods based on kernel smoothing. The projection pursuit guided tour is also useful for comparing and developing projection pursuit indexes and illustrating some types of asymptotic results.},
