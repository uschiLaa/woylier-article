date: "2023-09-15"
abstract: >
  The woylier package implements tour interpolation paths between frames using Givens rotations. This provides an alternative to the geodesic interpolation between planes currently available in the tourr package. Tours are used to visualise high-dimensional data and models, to detect clustering, anomalies and non-linear relationships. Frame-to-frame interpolation can be useful for projection pursuit guided tours when the index is not rotationally invariant. It also provides a way to specifically reach a given target frame. We demonstrate the method for exploring non-linear relationships between currency cross-rates.

# Introduction

When data has up to three variables, visualization is relatively intuitive, while with more than three variables, we face the challenge of visualizing high dimensions on 2D displays. This issue was tackled by the *grand tour* [@asimov_1985] which can be used to view data in more than three dimensions using linear projections. It is based on the idea of rotations of a lower-dimensional projection in high-dimensional space. The grand tour allows users to see dynamic low-dimensional (typically 2D) projections of higher dimensional space. Originally, Asimov's grand tour presents the viewer with an automatic movie of projections with no user control. Since then new work has added interactivity to the tour, giving more control to users [@buja_cook_asimov_hurley_2005]. New variations include the manual [@cook_manual_1997] or radial tour [@mmtour], little tour, guided tour [@grandtour1995], local tour, and planned tour. These are different ways of selecting the sequence of projection bases for the tour, for an overview see @tourrev.

The guided tour combines projection pursuit with the grand tour and it is implemented in the \CRANpkg{tourr} package [@tourr]. Projection pursuit is a procedure used to locate the projection of high-to-low dimensional space that should expose the most interesting feature of data, originally proposed in @kruskal_1969. It involves defining a criterion of interest, a numerical objective function that indicates the interestingness of each projection, and an optimization for selecting planes with increasing values of the function. In the literature, a number of such criteria have been developed based on clustering, spread, and outliers. 

A tour path is a sequence of projections and we use an interpolation to produce small steps simulating a smooth movement. The current implementation of tour in the \CRANpkg{tourr} package uses geodesic interpolation between planes. The geodesic interpolation path is the shortest path between planes with no within-plane spin (see @Buja2004TheoryOD for more details). As a result, the rendered target plane could be a within-plane rotation of the target plane originally specified. This is not a problem when the structure we are looking for can be identified from any rotation. However, even simple associations in 2D, such as the calculated correlation between variables, can be very different when the basis is rotated.

Most projection pursuit indexes, particularly those provided by in \CRANpkg{tourr} are rotationally invariant. However, there are some where the orientation of frames does matter. One example is the splines index proposed by @Grimm2016. The splines index computes a spline model for the two variables in a projection, in order to measure non-linear association. It compares the variance of the response variable to the variance of residuals, and the functional dependence is stronger when the index value is larger. It can be useful to detect non-linear relationships in high-dimensional data. However, its value will change substantially if the projection is rotated within the plane [@pp]. The procedure in @Grimm2016 was less affected by the orientation because it considered only pairs of variables, and it selects the maximum value found when exchanging which variable is considered as predictor and response variable.


Figure `r knitr::asis_output(ifelse(knitr::is_html_output(), '\\@ref(fig:splines2d-static)', '\\@ref(fig:splines2d-static)'))` illustrates the rotational invariance problem for a modified splines index, where we always consider the horizontal direction as the predictor variable, and the vertical direction as the response. Thus, our modified index computes the splines on one orientation, exaggerating the rotational variability. The example data was simulated to follow a sine curve and the modified splines index is calculated on different within-plane rotations of the data. Although they have the same structure, the index values vary greatly. 

The lack of rotation invariance of the splines index raises complications in the optimisation process in the projection-pursuit guided tour as available in \CRANpkg{tourr}. Fixing this is the motivation of this work. The goal with the frame-to-frame interpolation is that optimisation would find the best within-plane rotation, and thus appropriately optimize the index.

A few alternatives to geodesic interpolation were proposed by @buja_cook_asimov_hurley_2005 including the decomposition of orthogonal matrices, Givens decomposition, and Householder decomposition. The purpose of the **woylier** package is to implement the Givens paths method in R. This algorithm adapts the Given's matrix decomposition technique which allows the interpolation to be between frames rather than planes.

This article is structured as follows. The next section provides the theoretical framework of the Givens interpolation method followed by a section about the implementation in R. The method is applied to search for nonlinear associations between currency cross-rates.  

# Background

The tour method of visualization shows a movie that is an animated high-to-low dimensional data rotation. It is a one-parameter (time) family of static projections. Algorithms for such dynamic projections are based on the idea of smoothly interpolating a discrete sequence of projections [@buja_cook_asimov_hurley_2005]. 

The topic of this article is the construction of the paths of projections. The interpolation of these paths can be compared to connecting line segments that interpolate points in Euclidean space. Interpolation acts as a bridge between a continuous animation and the discrete choice of sequences of projections. 

**Interpolating paths of planes versus paths of frames**

The \CRANpkg{tourr} package implements geodesic interpolation between planes, and the final interpolation step will reach the rotation of the target frame that is avoiding any within-plane spin along the path. When the the orientation of projections matters interpolation between frames is required. The orientation of the frames could be important when a non-linear projection pursuit index function is used in the guided tour. This is illustrated by the different index values shown in the sketch in Figure `r knitr::asis_output(ifelse(knitr::is_html_output(), '\\@ref(fig:dogs)', '\\@ref(fig:dogs)'))`, as well as the splines index for the sine curve in Figure `r knitr::asis_output(ifelse(knitr::is_html_output(), '\\@ref(fig:splines2d-static)', '\\@ref(fig:splines2d-static)'))`. 

XXX I like the dog sketch but currently seems not really needed - what would be nice would be showing a bit more here: starting plane is the dog looking in a different direction and also at an angle, target is the one aligned as currently seen in the front, geodesic path gets us to the target view at the angle as seen in the starting plane, givens path gives the exact target. Not sure how difficult it would be to make this though...

```{r dogs, echo=FALSE, out.width="45%", fig.align = "center", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="Plane to plane interpolation (left) and Frame to frame interpolation (right). We used dog index for illustration purposes. For some non-linear index orientation of data could affect the index."}
knitr::include_graphics(
  c("plane.png",
    "frame.png"))
```

To describe the interpolation algorithms we will use the following notation. 

- Let $p$ be the dimension of original data and $d$ be the dimension onto which the data is being projected. 

- A frame $F$ is defined as a $p\times d$ matrix with pairwise orthogonal columns of unit length that satisfies
$$F^TF = I_d,$$
where $I_d$ is the identity matrix in d dimensions. 

- Paths of frames are given by continuous one-parameter families $F(t)$ where $t\in [a, z]$ represents time. We denote the starting frame (at time $a$) by $F_a = F(a)$ and target frame (at time $z$) by $F_z = F(z)$. Usually, $F_z$ is the target frame that has been chosen according to the selected tour method. While a grand tour chooses target frames randomly, the guided tour chooses the target frame by optimizing the projection pursuit index. Interpolation methods are used to find the path that moves from $F_a$ to $F_z$.


**Preprojection algorithm**

In order to make the interpolation algorithm simple, we carry out a preprojection step to find the subspace that the interpolation path, $F(t)$, is traversing. In other words, the preprojection step is defining the joint subspace of $F_a$ and $F_z$ and makes sure the interpolation path is limited to that space.

The procedure starts with forming an orthonormal basis by applying Gram-Schmidt to $F_z$ with regards to $F_a$, i.e. we find the $p\times d$ matrix that contains the component of $F_z$ that is orthogonal to $F_a$. We denote this orthonormal basis by $F_\star$. Then we build the preprojection basis $B$ by combining $F_a$ and $F_\star$ as follows:

$$B = (F_a, F_{\star})$$

The dimension of the resulting orthonormal basis, $B$, is $p\times 2d$.

Then, we can express the original frames in terms of this basis:

$$F_a = B W_a, F_z = B W_z$$

The interpolation problem is then reduced to the construction of paths of frames $W(t)$ that interpolate between the preprojected frames $W_a$ and $W_z$. By construction $W_a$ is a $2d\times d$ matrix of 1s and 0s. This is an important characteristic for our interpolation algorithm of choice, the Givens interpolation. 

**Givens interpolation path algorithm**

A rotation matrix is a transformation matrix used to perform a rotation in Euclidean space. The matrix that rotates a 2D plane by an angle $\theta$ looks like this:

$$ \begin{bmatrix}\cos \theta &-\sin \theta \\\sin \theta &\cos \theta \end{bmatrix} $$

If the rotation is in the plane of two selected variables, it is called a Givens rotation. Let's denote those 2 variables as $i$ and $j$. The Givens rotation is used for introducing zeros, for example when computing the QR decomposition of a matrix in linear algebra problems.

The interpolation method in the **woylier** package is based on the fact that in any vector of a matrix, one can zero out the $i$-th coordinate with a Givens rotation in the $(i, j)$-plane for any $j\neq i$ [@matrix_computation]. This rotation affects only coordinates $i$ and $j$ and leaves all other coordinates unchanged. 
Sequences of Givens rotations can map any orthonormal d-frame $F$ in p-space to the standard d-frame
$$E_d=((1, 0, 0, ...)^T, (0, 1, 0, ...)^T, ...).$$ 

The resulting interpolation path construction algorithm from starting frame $F_a$ to target frame $F_z$ is illustrated below. The example is for $p=6$ and $d=2$. 

1. Construct preprojection basis $B$ by orthonormalizing $F_z$ with regards tp $F_a$ with Gram-Schmidt.

In our example, $F_a$ and $F_z$ are $p\times d$ or $6\times2$ matrices that are orthonormal. The preprojection basis $B$ is $p\times 2d$ matrix that is $6\times 4$.

2. Get the preprojected frames using the preprojection basis $B$.
$$W_a = B^TF_a = E_d$$ and $$W_z = B^TF_z$$

In our example, $W_a$ looks like:


$$ \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 \\0  &1 \\ 0&0 \\0&0\end{bmatrix} $$

$W_z$ is an orthonormal $2d\times d$ matrix that looks like:

$$ \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\a_{21}  &a_{22} \\ a_{31}&a_{32} \\a_{41}&a_{42}\end{bmatrix} $$


3. Then, we can construct a sequence of Givens rotations that maps $W_z$ to $W_a$ with such angles that makes one element zero at a time:

$$ W_a = R_m(\theta_m) ... R_2(\theta_2)R_1(\theta_1)W_z$$ 

At each rotation, the angle $\theta_i$ that zero out the next coordinate of a plane is calculated. Here $m = \sum_{k=1}^d (2d - k)$, so when $d=2$ we need $m=5$ rotations with 5 different angles, each making one element 0. For example, the first rotation angle $\theta_1$ is an angle in radiant between $(1, 0)$ and $(a_{11}, a_{21})$. This rotation matrix would make element $a_{21}$ zero:

$$R_1(\theta_1) = G(1, 2, \theta_1) = \begin{bmatrix} cos\theta_1 & -sin\theta_1 & 0 & 0 \\sin\theta_1  &cos\theta_1 & 0 &0 \\ 0&0&1&0 \\0&0&0&1\end{bmatrix}$$
Here $G(i,j,\theta_k)$ denotes a Givens rotation in components $i$ and $j$ by angle $\theta_k$.
In the same way we zero out the elements $a_{31}$ and $a_{41}$. Because of the orthonormality this means that now $a_{11} = 1$ and that $a_{12} = 0$. We thus need only two more rotations to zero out $a_{32}$ and $a_{42}$.

XXX something about how we calculate theta?

4. The inverse mapping is obtained by reversing the sequence of rotations with the negative of the angles, we starts from the starting basis and end at the target basis. 

$$R(\theta) = R_1(-\theta_1) ... R_m(-\theta_m), \    W_z = R(\theta)W_a$$

Performing these rotations would go from the starting frame to the target frame in one step. But we want to do it sequentially in a number of steps so interpolation between frames looks dynamic. 

5. Next we include the time parameter, $t$, so that the interpolation process can be rendered in the movie-like sequence. We break each $\theta_k$ into the number of steps, $n_{step}$, that we want to take from the starting frame to the target frame, which means it moves by equal angle in each step. Here $n_{step}$ should vary based on the angular distance between $F_a$ and $F_z$, such that when watching a sequence of interpolations we have a fixed angular speed.

6. Finally, we reconstruct our original frames using $B$. This reconstruction is done at each step of interpolation so that we have the interpolated path of frames as the result.

$$F_t = B  W_t$$

At each time $t$ we can project the data using the frame $F_t$.

# Implementation

We implemented each steps in the Givens interpolation path algorithm in separate functions and combined them in the `givens_full_path()` function for deriving the full set of $F_t$. The same functions are used to integrate the Givens interpolation with the `animate()` functions of the \CRANpkg{tourr} package. Here is the input and output of each functions and it's descriptions, functions to use with `animate()` are described separately below.

When using \CRANpkg{tourr} we typically want to run a tour live, such that target selection and interpolation are interleaved, and the display will show the data for each frame $F_t$ in the interpolation path. The implementation in \CRANpkg{tourr} was described in @tourr, and with  \CRANpkg{woylier} we provide functions to use the Givens interpolation with the grand tour, guided tour and planned tour. To do this we rely primarily on the function `givens_info()` which calls the functions listed in the Table above and collects all necessary information for interpolating between a given starting and target frame. The function `givens_path()` then defines the interpolation and can be used instead of `tourr::geodesic_path()`. Wrapper functions for the different tour types are available to use this interpolation, since in the `tourr::grand_tour()` and other path functions this is fixed to use the geodesic interpolation. Calling a grand tour with Givens interpolation for direct animation will then use:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
tourr::animate_xy(<data>, tour_path = woylier::grand_tour_givens())
```



# Comparison of geodesic interpolation and Givens interpolation

The `givens_full_path()` function returns the intermediate interpolation step projections for a given number of steps. The code chunk below demonstrates the interpolation between 2 random bases in 5 steps.

XXX maybe drop the printout of base1 and base2 since output is not shown anyways?

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
set.seed(2022)
p <- 6
base1 <- tourr::basis_random(p, d=2)
base2 <- tourr::basis_random(p, d=2)

base1
base2
```

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
givens_full_path(base1, base2, nsteps = 5)
```

To compare the path generated with the Givens interpolation to that found with geodesic interpolations we look at the rotation of the sine data shown in Figure `r knitr::asis_output(ifelse(knitr::is_html_output(), '\\@ref(fig:splines2d-static)', '\\@ref(fig:splines2d-static)'))`. We consider a subset in $p=4$ dimensions where the first two dimensions contain noise and the last two contain the sine curve. Starting from a random projection we want to interpolate towards the original sine curve. The path comparison is shown in  Figure `r knitr::asis_output(ifelse(knitr::is_html_output(), '\\@ref(fig:compare-paths)', '\\@ref(fig:compare-paths)'))`.


```{r compare-paths, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, out.width="80%", fig.width=6, fig.height=10, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Comparison of Givens path and geodesic path between 2D projections. The Givens path preserves the frame ending at the provided basis (frame), while geodesic is agnostic to the particular basis. In general the geodesic is preferred because it removes within-plane spin, but occasionally it is helpful to very specifically arrive at the prescribed basis."}

```

**Plotting the interpolated paths**

For further comparison and to check that the interpolation is moving in equally sized steps we directly plot the interpolated paths. The space of 1D projections defines a unit sphere, while 2D projections define a torus. To illustrate the space, points on the surface of the sphere and the torus shape are randomly generated by functions from the \CRANpkg{geozoo} package [@geozoo]. The interpolated paths are then compared within that space.

A 1D projection of data in $p$ dimensions corresponds to a linear combination where the weights are normalized. Therefore, we can plot the point on the surface of a hypersphere. In this case the Givens interpolation will reach the exact point, while geodesic interpolation might flip the direction and reach a point on the opposite side of the hypersphere. Figure `r knitr::asis_output(ifelse(knitr::is_html_output(), '\\@ref(fig:1d-path-dynamic)', '\\@ref(fig:1d-path-static)'))` (left) shows the comparison of the interpolation steps using the same target plane, for an example with $p=3$. Because the flipped target is close to the starting plane, the geodesic path is a lot shorter.

In case of 2D projections, we can plot the interpolated path between 2 frames on a torus. A torus can be seen as crossing of 2 circles that are orthonormal, as is the case with our projection onto 2D. Figure `r knitr::asis_output(ifelse(knitr::is_html_output(), '\\@ref(fig:1d-path-dynamic)', '\\@ref(fig:1d-path-static)'))` (right) compares the interpolation paths for $p=3$.

For a 2D projection the same target plane is found when rotating the basis within the plane, or when reflecting across one of the two directions (the reflected basis can then also be rotated). This means the space of target bases is constrained to two circles on the torus, and these are disconnected because the reflection corresponds to a jump. In the high-dimensional space we can imagine the reflection as flipping over the target plane, resulting in a reflection of the normal vector on the plan.
While the Givens interpolation will reach the exact basis, a geodesic interpolation towards the same target plane can land anywhere along those two circles, depending on the starting basis in the interpolation.

# Data application

This section describes the application of Givens interpolation path with guided tour to explore non-linear association in multivariate data. We use cross-rates for currencies relative to the US dollar. A cross-rate is an exchange rate between two currencies computed by reference to a third currency, usually the US dollar. 

The data was extracted from [openexchangerates](https://openexchangerates.org) and contains cross-rate for ARS, AUD, EUR, JPY, KRW, MYR between 2019-11-1 to 2020-03-31. Figure `r knitr::asis_output(ifelse(knitr::is_html_output(), '\\@ref(fig:currency)', '\\@ref(fig:currency)'))` shows how the currencies changed relative to USD over the time period. We see some collective behavior in March of 2020 with EUR and JPY increasing in a similar manner, and smaller currencies decreasing in value. This could be understood as a consequence of flight-to-quality at this uncertain times.  

```{r currency, out.width="100%", fig.width = 9, fig.height = 4.5, layout = "l-body", fig.cap="All the currencies are standardised and the sign is flipped. The high value means the currency strengthened against the USD, and low means that it weakened."}
rates <- read_csv("rates_Nov19_Mar20.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) %>% 
  select(date, ARS, AUD, EUR, JPY, KRW, MYR) 
rates_sub <- rates %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, function(x) -1*(x-mean(x))/sd(x))
rates_sub_long <- rates_sub %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=ARS:MYR, 
               names_to="currency",
               values_to="crossrate") 
ggplot(rates_sub_long, aes(x=date, y=crossrate, colour=currency)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_colour_brewer("", palette = "Dark2") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 0.3,
        legend.position = "bottom")
# saving months for coloring in later
rate_march <- lubridate::month(rates$date)==3
```

We are interested in capturing this relations over time, and from the time series visualization we expect that we can capture the main dynamics in a two-dimensional projection from the six-dimensional space of currencies. Thus we start from $p=6$ (the different currencies) and $n=152$ the number of days in our sample. We expect that a projection onto $d=2$ dimensions should capture the relation between the two groups of currencies mentioned above, and this should be identified within the noise of the random fluctuations.


We may expect that we can capture the dependence between the two groups using principal components analysis. Figure `r knitr::asis_output(ifelse(knitr::is_html_output(), '\\@ref(fig:pca-result-static)', '\\@ref(fig:pca-result-static)'))` shows a scatter plot matrix of the PCs of our dataset. Indeed we find strong non-linear association between the first two PCs. Investigation of the rotation shows that the first principal component is primarily a balanced combination between ARS, AUD, KRW and MYR (and a smaller contribution of EUR), and the second contribution is dominated by EUR and JPY contrasted with smaller contributions from ARS and MYR. Our next step is thus to use projection pursuit to identify the best projection matrix that captures the non-linear functional dependence.

```{r pca-result-static, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.width=8, fig.height=8, fig.align = "center", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="There is a strong non-linear dependence between PC1 and PC2. Observations in March 2020 are highlighted in dark blue, all other months are shown in grey."}
# Use PCA to remove linear dependence
rates_pca <- prcomp(rates[,-1], scale. = TRUE)
pca <- ggscatmat(cbind(tibble::as_tibble(rates_pca$x), rate_march),
                 color = "rate_march") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("grey", "darkblue")) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1,
        legend.position = "none") +
  xlab("") + ylab("")
pca
```

# Use PCA to remove linear dependence
rates_pca <- prcomp(rates[,-1], scale. = TRUE)
pca <- ggscatmat(rates_pca$x)

**Guided tour optimisation**

We now use the splines index to identify a projection with functional dependence between the first and second direction of the projection. Note here that because of strong linear correlations between the currencies, we start from the first four principal components, explaining over 97% of the variance in the data. To avoid starting from the view already identified in the first two principal components we start from a projections onto the third and forth principal components. The PCA display in `tourr` is used to show each projection axes display in terms of the original variables, while only touring within the smaller space spanned by the first four principal components.

The results are shown in Figure `r knitr::asis_output(ifelse(knitr::is_html_output(), '\\@ref(fig:rates-tour-animated)', '\\@ref(fig:rates-tour-static)'))` and we see on the right that the guided tour with Givens interpolation has identified a non-linear functional dependence between the x and y axis in the final projection. The result on the left is using geodesic optimization, and the result in the middle is using a random search with geodesic interpolation. Since these methods do not allow for within-plane rotation they were not able to identify the same view even though they are using the same starting plane and index function.

To understand the result in more detail we use tools from \CRANpkg{ferrn} [@ferrn] to show how the index value is changing over the optimization in Figure `r knitr::asis_output(ifelse(knitr::is_html_output(), '\\@ref(fig:rates-ferrn)', '\\@ref(fig:rates-ferrn)'))`. Points indicate selected target planes, and are connected by lines showing the index value along the interpolated path between them.

The top row is showing the path found via geodesic optimization. This search strategy only moves along geodesic paths, and cannot select target frames with rotation within the plane. We can see that as a consequence the optimization converges to a local optimum and the search does not identify the pattern of interest.

In the middle we are showing the path found when using a random search in combination with geodesic interpolation. In this case the search can suggest any target frame (allowing for within-plane rotation), but the interpolation step will reset the orientation. This is why we see drops in the index value even from one target plane to the next, and the optimization also does not identify the pattern of interest.

Finally in the bottom row we see the result of the random search with Givens interpolation. While the index value can drop along an interpolation path, the value is strictly increasing for the target planes, as is required for the optimization. Note also that the search converged much faster (fewer target planes were selected). The length of the interpolated paths is similar, because for fixed angular step size the Givens interpolation will take more steps to interpolate between frames.


```{r rates-ferrn, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.cap="Splines index value along the interpolated optimisation path in the guided tour using geodesic optimisation (top), simulated annealing with geodesic interpolation (middle) and simulated annealing with givens interpolation (bottom).

# Conclusion

The R package **woylier** provides implementation of Givens interpolation path algorithm that can be used as an alternative interpolation method for tour. The algorithm implemented in the **woylier** package comes from @buja_cook_asimov_hurley_2005. We illustrate the use of the functions provided in the package for R users.

The motivation to develop this package comes from rotational invariance problem of current geodesic interpolation algorithm implemeneted in \CRANpkg{tourr} package. The package gives users the ability to detect non-linear association between variables more precisely. 

It is important to mention that **woylier** package should be integrated with \CRANpkg{tourr} package. The future improvements that needs to be done in the package is to generalize the interpolation for more than 2d projections of data.
