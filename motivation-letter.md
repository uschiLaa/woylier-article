Dear Professor Urbanek,
\bigskip

Please consider our article titled "Frame to frame interpolation for high-dimensional data visualisation using the woylier package" for publication in the R Journal.

The manuscript introduces the new package called `Woylier` which implements tour interpolation paths between frames using Givens rotations. This offers an alternative approach to the geodesic interpolation between planes featured in the tourr package. Since it provides a way to reach a given target frame, the frame-to-frame interpolation can be useful for projection pursuit guided tours where the index is not rotationally invariant. 

We believe the readers of the R Journal will find this article helpful because the frame-to-frame interpolation can be applied across various use cases, particularly in cases where the objective is to detect bivariate non-linear association in high-dimensional data.
